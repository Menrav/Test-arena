        learners *schools name* prides itself on developing independent thinkers
        who will have the cognitive skills to access life-long learning. In
        grades 8 and 9, the academic programme is delivered within the Round
        Square Discovery Framework where the focus is on teaching skills rather
        than content alone. The learners are exposed to a number of critical
        thinking programmes such as the De Bono Thinking Hats, the Thinking Maps
        and Growth Mindset which prioritises a Growth Mindset outlook on
        learning. We take great pride in developing young learners beyond the
        school curriculum. *Schools name* prepares learners for the university
        entrance examinations. This examination allows learners entry into local
        and international institutions of higher learning.
